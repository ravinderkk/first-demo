this is first github file on 05.02.2018
adding new file in remote 
First, I created a new directory C:Ravinder Then, issuae a command "gitinitGitProject" and it will
generate a sub directory named GitProject
The GitProject contains all of our necessary treptositary files -a git repositary scalton. At this point, nothing in our project is tracked yet.
Note that we could have issued the "gitinit" command within the directory , "GitProject" , then it would have created .git subdirectory.
Now, we may want to create some files.
adding new line in remote repositary.
